# Note-Taking-App ("Knowledge Tree")
Note Taking App (Django, JavaScript, Bootstrap)

Knowledge Tree is a note taking app designed to provide easy organisation, categorisation and searchability of notes. Multiple users can upload notes to a common
feed. Django backend to handle database, user profiles and authentication, and JavaScript / Bootstrap frontend for asynchronous functions, cookie handling and styling.
Regex searches to allow complex querying and grouping of notes from the database. Autosave feature to prevent data-loss
and works with Evernote API in order to allow note transfer between the two apps.

To use this app you will need to add your Django secret key to secrets.py as well as your evernote consumer and secret keys to oauth/config.py
