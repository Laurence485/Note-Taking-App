MySQL db?

A post can have many categories (be labeled by many categories), and a category can have many posts (be labeled by many posts).

3 tables. |Post| <- |Labels| -> |Categories|

set up a many to many relationship s.t the post_id column in Labels references
the id column in Post and the category_id in Labels references the id column
in Categories.

So each row of the Labels table will use 2 Foreign Keys to create an association
between rows of Posts and rows of Categories.
